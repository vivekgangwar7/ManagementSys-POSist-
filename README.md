# ManagementSys-POSist-
Basically, a Tree Hierarichal Structure consisting of different operations.
Consists of two structure
1. Data- consists of basic information of the user.
2. node - complete structure of node as defined by the user.
Class Admin handles all the operations
It consits of 10 different functions which are defined some requires database permission for password. Or otherwise I need to build a large hashmap for password as well and have to encorporate that with the node. Which was not mentioned in the assignment that's why I preassumed that we would require db connection
